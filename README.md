# Patient_Survival_Prediction
For this project, you will train a XGBoost model to predict survival of patients with heart failure. After that, you will save the trained model, create a Gradio-based app, build &amp; push docker image to ECR, and deploy the application with ECS. Please refer to the Demo session - ECR ECS held on April 19th for this mini-project.
